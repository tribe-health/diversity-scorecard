## Disease Incidence Analysis

### Relative Risk by Demographics

| Demographic Group | Disease Incidence | Trial Representation | Assessment |
|------------------|-------------------|---------------------|------------|
| Black/African American | Increased | Below Benchmark | Needs Improvement |
| Hispanic/Latino | Similar | Meeting Benchmark | Adequate |
| Elderly (65+) | Increased | Meeting Benchmark | Adequate |

## Recommendations

1. **Priority Areas for Improvement:**
   - Increase recruitment of Black/African American participants
   - Expand outreach to multiple race/other race categories
   - Enhance data collection for non-binary gender identities

2. **Successful Strategies to Maintain:**
   - Age distribution across adult categories
   - Hispanic/Latino representation
   - Gender balance initiatives

3. **Action Items:**
   - Establish partnerships with community organizations serving underrepresented populations
   - Review recruitment strategies in areas with higher minority populations
   - Implement targeted outreach programs for identified gaps
